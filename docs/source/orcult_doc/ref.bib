abstract = {Global temporal composites of surface reflectances are among the most commonly used products of wide field-of-view satellite-borne instruments such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and VEGETATION. The multi-temporal and spatial consistencies of these composites are key elements for their usefulness. In this paper, we use two different criteria to evaluate the quality of existing and new temporal composite products in SPOT–VEGETATION imagery. The first criterion, based on variograms, analyses the spatial characteristics of composite images, and the second one evaluates the quality of the time series based on the analysis of simultaneous imagery from VEGETATION 1 and VEGETATION 2. Thanks to these criteria, we show that the standard deviation of the errors that affect the surface reflectances of current composite products can be reduced by a factor greater than 2 using improved algorithms detailed in this paper. Finally, we produce multi-instrument composites by integrating images from both VEGETATION instruments to further improve the composite products.}

ABSTRACT = {For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.},

In-field measurement of the BRDF of vegetation canopies improves the characterization of off-nadir measurements and informs radiative transfer models of canopy reflectance, where the Lambertian assumption does not hold. However, current field goniometers are unable to measure BRDF efficiently, especially for tall vegetation across the growing season because of the limitations of clearance, field accessibility, and flexibility of the sensor field of view. In this study, we explored the potential of using a large-scale cable-suspended field phenotyping system to quantify BRDF of the canopy reflectance at selected bands and Vegetation Indices (VIs) of maize and soybean canopies. The system performance benefited from the following conditions: no crop damage, full-season field accessibility of tall canopies, automatic measurement, and accurate positioning. Correlation analysis shows that a strong correlation exists among the reflectance, VIs, and the Green Pixel Fraction. The hemispheric distributions of the spectral reflectance at selected bands and VIs were quantified at multiple dates. Hot spots were observed in the backscatter direction at visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands at the largest sensor zenith angle around the Solar Principal Plane (SPP). In contrast, cold spots of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its related VIs were observed in the backscatter direction around solar zenith angles. The row effect was found for the maize canopy at the NIR band and the Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv). NDVI had the lowest anisotropy index values among investigated bands and VIs. This system could be further leveraged to generate rapid and detailed BRDF data at a high spatiotemporal resolution using multiple sensors.}

abstract = {The Landsat satellites have been providing spectacular imagery of the Earth's surface for over 40years. However, they acquire images at view angles ±7.5° from nadir that cause small directional effects in the surface reflectance. There are also variations with solar zenith angle over the year that can cause apparent change in reflectance even if the surface properties remain constant. When Landsat data from adjoining paths, or from long time series are used, a model of the surface anisotropy is required to adjust all Landsat observations to a uniform nadir view (primarily for visual consistency, vegetation monitoring, or detection of subtle surface changes). Here a generalized approach is developed to provide consistent view angle corrections across the Landsat archive. While this approach is not applicable for generation of Landsat surface albedo, which requires a full characterization of the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), or for correction to a constant solar illumination angle across a wide range of sun angles, it provides Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) for a range of terrestrial monitoring applications. The Landsat NBAR is derived as the product of the observed Landsat reflectance and the ratio of the reflectances modeled using MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters for the observed Landsat and for a nadir view and fixed solar zenith geometry. In this study, a total of 567 conterminous United States (CONUS) January and July 2010 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images that have swath edge overlapping paths sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations were used. The average difference between Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the overlapping Landsat scan edges was quantified. The CONUS July view zenith BRDF effects were about 0.02 in the Landsat visible bands, and about 0.03, 0.05 and 0.06, in the 2.1μm, 1.6μm and near-infrared bands respectively. Comparisons of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ NBAR derived using MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters defined with respect to different spatial and temporal scales, and defined with respect to different land cover types, were undertaken. The results suggest that, because the BRDF shapes of different terrestrial surfaces are sufficiently similar over the narrow 15° Landsat field of view, a fixed set of MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters may be adequate for Landsat NBAR derivation with little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance. A fixed set of BRDF spectral model parameters, derived from a global year of highest quality snow-free MODIS BRDF product values, are provided so users may implement the described Landsat NBAR generation method.}

ABSTRACT = {Digital agriculture services can greatly assist growers to monitor their fields and optimize their use throughout the growing season. Thus, knowing the exact location of fields and their boundaries is a prerequisite. Unlike property boundaries, which are recorded in local council or title records, field boundaries are not historically recorded. As a result, digital services currently ask their users to manually draw their field, which is time-consuming and creates disincentives. Here, we present a generalized method, hereafter referred to as DECODE (DEtect, COnsolidate, and DElinetate), that automatically extracts accurate field boundary data from satellite imagery using deep learning based on spatial, spectral, and temporal cues. We introduce a new convolutional neural network (FracTAL ResUNet) as well as two uncertainty metrics to characterize the confidence of the field detection and field delineation processes. We finally propose a new methodology to compare and summarize field-based accuracy metrics. To demonstrate the performance and scalability of our method, we extracted fields across the Australian grains zone with a pixel-based accuracy of 0.87 and a field-based accuracy of up to 0.88 depending on the metric. We also trained a model on data from South Africa instead of Australia and found it transferred well to unseen Australian landscapes. We conclude that the accuracy, scalability and transferability of DECODE shows that large-scale field boundary extraction based on deep learning has reached operational maturity. This opens the door to new agricultural services that provide routine, near-real time field-based analytics.},

ABSTRACT = {The Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (HLS) project aims to generate a seamless surface reflectance product by combining observations from USGS/NASA Landsat-8 and ESA Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites. These satellites’ sampling characteristics provide nearly constant observation geometry and low illumination variation through the scene. However, the illumination variation throughout the year impacts the surface reflectance by producing higher values for low solar zenith angles and lower reflectance for large zenith angles. In this work, we present a model to derive the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization and apply it to the HLS product at 30 m spatial resolution. It is based on the BRDF parameters estimated from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product (M{O,Y}D09) at 1 km spatial resolution using the VJB method (Vermote et al., 2009). Unsupervised classification (segmentation) of HLS images is used to disaggregate the BRDF parameters to the HLS spatial resolution and to build a BRDF parameters database at HLS scale. We first test the proposed BRDF normalization for different solar zenith angles over two homogeneous sites, in particular one desert and one Peruvian Amazon forest. The proposed method reduces both the correlation with the solar zenith angle and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the reflectance time series in the red and near infrared bands to 4% in forest and keeps a low CV of 3% to 4% for the deserts. Additionally, we assess the impact of the view zenith angle (VZA) in an area of the Brazilian Amazon forest close to the equator, where impact of the angular variation is stronger because it occurs in the principal plane. The directional reflectance shows a strong dependency with the VZA. The current HLS BRDF correction reduces this dependency but still shows an under-correction, especially in the near infrared, while the proposed method shows no dependency with the view angles. We also evaluate the BRDF parameters using field surface albedo measurements as a reference over seven different sites of the US surface radiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) and five sites of the Australian OzFlux network.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing allows fast assessment of crop monitoring over large areas; however, questions regarding uncertainty in crop parameter prediction and application to nitrogen (N) fertilization remain open. The objective of this study was to optimize of remote sensing spectral information for its application to grain yield (GY), biomass, grain N concentration (GNC), and N output assessment, and decision making on spring wheat fertilization. Spring wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) field experiments testing two tillage treatments, two irrigation levels and six N treatments were conducted in Northwest Mexico over four consecutive years. Hyperspectral images were acquired through 27 airborne flight campaigns. At harvest, GY, biomass, GNC and N output were determined. Spectral exploratory analysis was used to identify the best wavelength combinations, the most suitable vegetation indices (VIs) and the best growth stages to assess the agronomic variables. The relationship between the spectral information and the agronomic measurements was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The ability of the indices to guide fertilizer recommendation was assessed through an error analysis based on the N sufficiency index. GY was better assessed from the end of flowering to the early milk stage by VIs based on the combination of bands from near infrared radiation/visible and from near infrared radiation/red-edge regions (R2 &gt; 0.6; RMSE &lt; 700 kg ha−1). N output was efficiently assessed by a combination of bands from near infrared radiation/red-edge at booting (R2 &gt; 0.7; RMSE &lt; 9 kg N ha−1). The GNC was better estimated by VIs combining bands in near infrared radiation/red-edge at early milk, but with great variability among the years studied. Some VIs were promising for guiding fertilizer recommendation for increasing GNC, but there was not a single index providing reliable recommendations every year. This study highlights the potential of remote sensing imagery to assess GY and N output in spring wheat, but the identification of GNC responsive sites needs to be improved.},

ABSTRACT = {Parcel-level cropland maps are an essential data source for crop yield estimation, precision agriculture, and many other agronomy applications. Here, we proposed a rice field mapping approach that combines agricultural field boundary extraction with fine-resolution satellite images and pixel-wise cropland classification with Sentinel-1 time series SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery. The agricultural field boundaries were delineated by image segmentation using U-net-based fully convolutional network (FCN) models. Meanwhile, a simple decision-tree classifier was developed based on rice phenology traits to extract rice pixels with time series SAR imagery. Agricultural fields were then classified as rice or non-rice by majority voting from pixel-wise classification results. The evaluation indicated that SeresNet34, as the backbone of the U-net model, had the best performance in agricultural field extraction with an IoU (Intersection over Union) of 0.801 compared to the simple U-net and ResNet-based U-net. The combination of agricultural field maps with the rice pixel detection model showed promising improvement in the accuracy and resolution of rice mapping. The produced rice field map had an IoU score of 0.953, while the User&lsquo;s Accuracy and Producer&lsquo;s Accuracy of pixel-wise rice field mapping were 0.824 and 0.816, respectively. The proposed model combination scheme merely requires a simple pixel-wise cropland classification model that incorporates the agricultural field mapping results to produce high-accuracy and high-resolution cropland maps.},

ABSTRACT = {The spatial assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major environmental challenge, notably for evaluating soil carbon stocks. Recent works have shown the capability of Sentinel-2 optical data to predict SOC content over temperate agroecosystems characterized by annual crops, using a single acquisition date. Considering a Sentinel-2 time series, this work intends to analyze the impact of acquisition date, and related weather and soil surface conditions on the prediction performance of topsoil SOC content (plough layer). A Sentinel-2 time-series was gathered, comprised of the dates corresponding to both the maximum of bare soil coverage and minimum of cloud coverage. Cross-validated partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were constructed between soil reflectance image spectra, and SOC content analyzed from 329 top soil samples collected over the study area. Cross-validation R2 ranged from 0.005 to 0.58, root mean square error from 5.86 to 3.02 g&middot;kg&minus;1 and residual prediction deviation values from 1.0 to 1.5 (without unit), according to date. The main factors influencing these differences were soil roughness, in conjunction with soil moisture, and the cloud and cloud shadow cover of the entire tile. The best performing dates were spring dates characterized by both lowest soil surface roughness and moisture content. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values below 0.35 did not influence prediction performance. This consolidates the previous results obtained during single date acquisitions and offers wider perspectives for the further use of Sentinel-2 into multidate mosaics for digital soil mapping.},
